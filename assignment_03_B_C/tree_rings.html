<h1>TreeRings Users Manual</h1>

<h3>What is the set of all SVG images which can be generated by <i>TreeRings</i>?</h3>
The <i>TreeRings</i> application can generate an SVG image consisting of 
from 1 to 5 rings.
<p>
Each ring consists of a number of binary trees drawn the same distance from the origin.
<p>
In a single SVG image, all the trees are the same size and shape.
From one image to another, the trees can vary in height, branching angle and branch scale factor.
<p>
For example:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="tree_rings0.svg">Tree 0</a>
has a single ring containing a tree with height 10, branching angle pi/8 and branch factor 0.8.
The tree contains a root element.
The left and right children branch at an angle of pi/8 and are
0.8 the length of the root.
<p><li>
<a href="tree_rings1.svg">Tree 1</a> has 5 rings,
each containing trees with height 2, branching angle pi/8 and branch factor 0.8.
<p><li>
<a href="tree_rings2.svg">Tree 2</a>
has 4 rings, each containing trees with height 7, branching angle pi/8 and branch factor 0.8.
</ul>

<h3>What application(s) are supported by <i>TreeRings</i>?</h3>
<i>TreeRings</i> supports one application: <tt>tree_rings.sh</tt>.
<p>
To invoke <tt>tree_rings.sh</tt> from the Linux command line:
<pre>
	bash tree_rings.sh number_of_rings tree_height branch_angle branch_factor
</pre>

<h3>What shell commands are used to generate the SVG images above?</h3>
To generate Tree 0:
<pre>
	bash tree_rings.sh 1 10 0.39269908169872414 0.8
	mv tree_rings.svg tree_rings0.svg
</pre>

To generate Tree 1:
<pre>
	bash tree_rings.sh 5 2 0.39269908169872414 0.8
	mv tree_rings.svg tree_rings1.svg
</pre>

To generate Tree 2:
<pre>
	bash tree_rings.sh 4 7 0.39269908169872414 0.8
	mv tree_rings.svg tree_rings2.svg
</pre>

Note: pi/8 is approximately 0.39269908169872414.
